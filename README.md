## Features
* No centralized dependency (100% on Arweave)
* Play-to-earn model (Smartweave PST token)
* Easy-to-use and lightweight UI
* Compatible with major crossword puzzle standard file formats and apps

## How it Works
Creators submit their crossword puzzles along with an optional reward (PST token)
to the Smartweave contract (via UI). Players can see all puzzles and the
associated rewards. The first player who solves a puzzle, wins the reward in
full. Once a puzzle's been solved, others can see the winner (and stop trying).
